# Clac3

- "proof-of-concept" for more flexible macros 
- strong macro system that allows any syntax as long as it gets mapped to functional form
    - uses a decision tree for faster matching
    - supports user-defined operators
- allows for the creation of domain-specific-languages and custom syntax in the langauge itself
- currently has no front-end
